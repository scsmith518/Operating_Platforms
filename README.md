# Operating_Platforms

The Gaming Room has decided to develop a web-based game. At the moment the clientâ€™s game is only available on an android application. The application they are wanted to make is currently called: Draw it, or Lose It. The client is hoping to serve all platforms and not just android. The idea for the game was based off a 1980s television game: Win, Lose, or Draw.
Requirements

I did well at adressing the the deign constraints.

I did very well in creating the UHL Diafram

I found the UHL diagrame was very helpfull in developing the code.

I would improve the Development requirments by being more detailed.

I interpeted the user needs in the Design Constrants.  It is important to know what the client needs in the intial stage of the software design.

I belive understanding the design constaints, clietns desires, and creating a UML diagrame are curcial in analyzing and design of a software application
